fMRI analysis tools and techniques

focusing on the most important recent developments
in this field, and the importance of these techniques and tools in
fMRI-based research, together with your own views


INTRO ATTEMPT

* we as a community want to tackle problems that are beyond the reach of a
  single lab or a single institution
* and that is why we love the HBP and HCP (at least the funders do)
* two ways:
  - massive taxpayer money waste
  - grass-roots movement

NEW STRUCTURE ATTEMPT

* open collaboration using commodities
  - tools (libraries available)
  - data (data sharing)
  - research (knowledge, blogs, ...)
* scalable computing


THE MEAT

neurosynth:
 - one guy made it
 - using lots of 3rd-party data and tools -> incremental

 neurovault:
 - identified limitation of neursynth
 - facilitate "proper" meta analysis
 -> incremental

Both made possible by tools from Nipy:
 - inspired by SPM
 - sparked nibabel, nipype, nilearn, scikit-learn, pymvpa --> contributions to
   other communities (algorithms in scipy)
 - more web-based collaboration, more "open"
 - explain "new" collaboration model: github, no central funded something,
   all in public
 - first attempt on unconstraint peer2peer project for fMRI analysis?
 - slicetime-motion correction ist single? new bit of technology

Cloud computing
 - minimize initial investment for "big data"
 - nitrc-ce/c-brain/newgrid

web-based (interactive) publication/visualization
 - xtk/webviz
 - example: gallantlab
 - tons of blogs (MVPA-related... maybe for any "new" technology in order to
   help dissemination an adaption)
 - youtube tutorials
 -> post-publication peer-review
    - neuroskeptic
    - example of post-publication peer-review enabled by the web

methods:

- alignment -> non-linear
  - HAMMER, ANTS, FNIRT
- hyperalignment
- parcellation
- RSA
- MVPA
- deep believe networks
