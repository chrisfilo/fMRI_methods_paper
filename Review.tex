\section{Review}

This should contain the body of the article, and may also be broken into subsections with short, informative headings.

\subsection{Benefit of shared tools}

working on community-based libraries

beyond simple sharing of in-house tools

move towards collaborative development

Examples:

- meta-analysis: neurosynth -- neurovault (web-service collaboration; no common funding))

- both heavily use tools from the Nipy univers (in turn an extension of the SPM
  development model, more de-centralized)

- comparative algorithm evaluation (Arno's alignment benchmark)

\subsection{Benefit of shared data}

mass-adoption started with resting state fmri (easy to record, simple to describe, easy to share)

more researchers from more fields get access and can contribute their skills and ideas

led to improved tools and techniques for unlabeled imaging data
(e.g. hyperalignment needs ``unusual'' data, but with more benefit people are more inclined to record it)

starts to translate into domain of natural stimulation (movies, \ldots)

\subsection{Knowledge sharing and evaluation}

no longer just pre-publication peer review

research blogs \ldots neuroskeptic

web demos, practical fMRI, countless wikis, youtube tutorials

no just among researchers, but also with the general public;
example: gallantlab -> justify tax investment into neuroimaging research

xtk/webviz

\subsection{Scalable computing}

shared/common computing resources for ad-hoc projects

minimize initial investment for "big data"

amazon, nitrc-ce, c-brain, newgrid, \ldots
